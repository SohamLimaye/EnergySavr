## **2. Deployment Overview**

### **2.1 Deployment Strategy**
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** A Blue-Green deployment strategy will be used to ensure zero downtime during the deployment process. The new version will be deployed in parallel with the existing one (Green), and once validated, traffic will be switched from Blue (old version) to Green (new version).

### **2.2 Components to be Deployed**
- **Web Application:** React.js front-end deployed on AWS S3 and CloudFront for CDN.
- **Mobile Application:** React Native mobile app deployed on Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
- **Backend Services:** Node.js server running on AWS Lambda, with API Gateway.
- **Database:** MongoDB hosted on AWS DynamoDB or MongoDB Atlas.

### **2.3 Environment Setup**
- **Development Environment:** Local development setup using Docker and Node.js.
- **Staging Environment:** A replica of the production environment for final testing.
- **Production Environment:** Live environment hosted on AWS with auto-scaling, load balancing, and monitoring.

---

## **3. Pre-Deployment Activities**

### **3.1 Code Review and Testing**
- **Code Freeze:** Ensure all code changes are finalized and merged.
- **Final Code Review:** Perform a final code review to catch any last-minute issues.
- **Automated Testing:** Run automated unit, integration, and system tests to validate the codebase.
- **Performance Testing:** Execute performance tests in the staging environment to identify bottlenecks.

### **3.2 Environment Preparation**
- **Staging Environment:** Deploy the latest build to the staging environment and run smoke tests.
- **Backup and Recovery Plan:** Ensure backups of the existing production environment are available and tested for recovery.
- **Security Check:** Conduct a final security audit to ensure all components are secure.

### **3.3 Data Migration**
- **Migration Scripts:** Prepare and test data migration scripts if schema changes are involved.
- **Data Backup:** Take a full backup of the production database before deployment.

### **3.4 Stakeholder Communication**
- **Deployment Schedule:** Communicate the deployment schedule to all stakeholders, including potential downtime.
- **User Notification:** Notify users about any expected downtime or service interruptions via email or in-app notifications.

## **4. Deployment Steps**

### **4.1 Deployment of Web Application**
- **Step 1:** Build the latest version of the React.js application.
- **Step 2:** Upload the build to AWS S3.
- **Step 3:** Invalidate the CloudFront cache to serve the latest version to users.

### **4.2 Deployment of Mobile Application**
- **Step 1:** Build the mobile app using React Native.
- **Step 2:** Submit the iOS app to the Apple App Store for review.
- **Step 3:** Submit the Android app to Google Play Store for review.

### **4.3 Deployment of Backend Services**
- **Step 1:** Deploy the Node.js application to AWS Lambda.
- **Step 2:** Update the API Gateway configurations to point to the new Lambda function.
- **Step 3:** Test the API endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly.

### **4.4 Database Deployment**
- **Step 1:** Apply schema changes (if any) to the production database.
- **Step 2:** Execute data migration scripts.
- **Step 3:** Validate data integrity after migration.

### **4.5 Verification**
- **Step 1:** Perform smoke tests on all components (web, mobile, backend) to ensure they are working as expected.
- **Step 2:** Monitor logs and performance metrics to identify any issues.

### **4.6 Switch Traffic (Blue-Green Deployment)**
- **Step 1:** If all tests pass, switch the production traffic from the Blue environment to the Green environment.
- **Step 2:** Monitor the system closely for any issues during the switch.
- **Step 3:** Rollback to the Blue environment if any critical issues are detected.

## **5. Post-Deployment Activities**

### **5.1 Monitoring and Support**
- **System Monitoring:** Use AWS CloudWatch, New Relic, or similar tools to monitor the systemâ€™s health and performance.
- **Error Logs:** Continuously monitor error logs and address any issues that arise.
- **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users to identify any post-deployment issues.

### **5.2 Performance Tuning**
- **Database Optimization:** Review database performance and apply necessary optimizations.
- **Backend Scaling:** Adjust auto-scaling policies based on initial load after deployment.

### **5.3 Final Sign-Off**
- **Verification:** Ensure all functionalities are working as expected in the production environment.
- **Stakeholder Approval:** Obtain final approval from stakeholders for the deployment.
- **Documentation Update:** Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new deployment.

### **5.4 Rollback Plan**
- **Backup Restoration:** In case of critical issues, restore the database from the backup taken before deployment.
- **Revert Deployment:** Switch back to the Blue environment if the Green environment fails.
- **Issue Tracking:** Document the issue and work on a fix before attempting redeployment.
