- **Performance Testing:** Load and stress testing will be conducted using tools like Apache JMeter to assess the system's performance under various conditions.
- **Security Testing:** Security testing will be performed to identify vulnerabilities in authentication, data storage, and data transmission.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The system will be tested by a select group of users to ensure it meets their requirements and expectations.

### **3.2 Tools**
- **Unit Testing:** Jest, Mocha, Chai
- **Integration Testing:** Postman, Selenium
- **System Testing:** Cypress, Selenium WebDriver
- **Performance Testing:** Apache JMeter, Gatling
- **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

## **8. Risks and Mitigation**

### **8.1 Risks**
- **Availability of Test Environment:** Delay in setting up the test environment may push back testing schedules.
- **Data Sensitivity:** The test environment contains sensitive user data that needs to be protected.
- **Third-Party Service Downtime:** Downtime of third-party services (e.g., External Energy API) could affect testing.

### **8.2 Mitigation**
- **Test Environment:** Ensure early setup and have a backup environment.
- **Data Protection:** Use anonymized data for testing.
- **Third-Party Services:** Have mock services in place to simulate third-party service responses.
